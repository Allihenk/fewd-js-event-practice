## Getting Started

* fork and clone this repository
* in your terminal:
  * `npm install` to install project dependencies
  * `npm start` to run the website at `http://localhost:3000`
  * `npm run lint` to check your JavaScript style with [semistandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard)

## Write JavaScript

Open `public/main.js` in your favorite text editor and write JavaScript so that on click:

* `button one` turns red (toggle CSS class `button-danger`) which means if clicked again it goes back to blue
* `button two` changes its inner text to `you clicked me`
* `button three` changes the inner text of `button two` back to "button two"
